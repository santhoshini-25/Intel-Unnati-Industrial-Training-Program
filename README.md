This project explores the application of Edge AI for analyzing vehicle movement and generating insights within a college campus. It leverages a combination of image data, historical vehicle activity data (entry/exit times, occupancy), and a database of authorized license plates. The system employs data preprocessing techniques and extracts valuable information through functionalities like License Plate Recognition (LPR). By analyzing timestamps and occupancy data, the project provides insights into movement patterns and parking behavior.
